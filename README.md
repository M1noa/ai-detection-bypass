# AI Detection Bypass

Use the prompt below to bypass text AI detectiors!

```
Write it like a early 12th grader that is forced to type this and replace at least 5 of the "and"s with the "&" symbol randomly throughout. Make it have 1-5 minor spelling mistakes randomly put throughout. Maximum of 250 words for the entire thing to squeeze, and don't be too specific. Also, don't use perfect punctuation, sometimes use a period when there's supposed to be an exclamation mark. Change some words to other words with the same meaning.
```

Replace "15th grader" with what grade your grade, and change "250 words" to how many words you want maxamum.

## Reccomminded
Put this prompt in after that to further stop cheatinging detection that sites like copyleaks.com do.
```
Change 20% words to other words with the same meaning.
