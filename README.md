# AI Detection Bypass

Use the prompt below to bypass text AI detectiors!

```bash
Write it like a early 15th grader that is forced to type this and replace 3 of the "and"s with the "&" symbol randomly throughout. Make it have 1-2 minor spelling mistakes randomly put throughout. Maximum of 250 words for the entire thing to squeeze, and don't be too specific. Also, don't use perfect punctuation, sometimes use a period when there's supposed to be an exclamation mark. Change some words to other words with the same meaning
```

Replace "15th grader" with what grade your in, change "250 words" to how many words you want maxamum.
