# AI Detection Bypass

Use the prompt below to bypass text AI detectiors!

```
Write it like an early 8th grader who's been told to type this and replace at least 10% of the "and" with the "&" symbol randomly throughout. Introduce 1-5 minor spelling mistakes randomly. Don't be overly specific. Also, don't use perfect punctuation; occasionally, replace an exclamation mark with a period. Swap out some words with synonyms. Make it a bit disorganized and somewhat sloppy. But full words only NO abbreviated. Change at least 30% words to other words with the same meaning. DON'T use any abbreviated words only full words.
```

Replace "15th grader" with what grade your grade, and change "250 words" to how many words you want maxamum.

## Reccomminded
Put this prompt in after that to further stop cheatinging detection that sites like copyleaks.com do.
```
Change at least 30% words to other words with the same meaning.
