# AI Detection Bypass

Use the prompt below after it writes whatever you need it to, to bypass text AI detectors!

```
Replace at least 10% of the "and" with the "&" symbol randomly throughout. Introduce 1-5 minor spelling mistakes randomly. Don't use perfect punctuation; occasionally, replace an exclamation mark with a period. Make it a bit disorganized. Change at least 30% of words to other words with the same meaning. Make it look like a professional 8th grader wrote it & shorten it a little. Also, make more complicated words easier to read so a teenager would be able to understand this.
```

## Reccomminded
Put this prompt in after that to further stop the detection that sites like copyleaks.com do.
```
Change at least most words to other words with the same meaning.
```
